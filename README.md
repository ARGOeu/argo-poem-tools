#argo-poem-tools
Configuration is in file `/etc/argo-poem-tools/argo-poem-tools.conf`. It consists of 2 sections: `[GENERAL]` and `[PROFILES]`. In the first section, tenant hostname and token are defined, and in second, there should be a comma separated list of metric profiles. Profile list must be the same as the one in NCG config file. 

Example config file:
```
[GENERAL]
Host = egi.tenant.com
Token = some-token-1234
[PROFILES]
MetricProfiles = ARGO_TEST, TEST_PROFILE
```

Host should correspond to tenantâ€™s fqdn and token may be obtained from POEM UI. The profiles must be defined in POEM.

The tool is run by calling `argo-poem-packages.py` and it is invoked as a part of NCG configuration. All the output is redirected to syslog.

Example output:
```
